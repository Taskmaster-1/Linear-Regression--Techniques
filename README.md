# Linear Regression Techniques

This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of linear regression techniques using a real-world economic dataset. Whether you are new to data science or looking to deepen your understanding of regression methods, this repository offers practical examples and clear explanations to help you get started.

## Overview

The project demonstrates the application of two key regression techniques:

- **Multiple Linear Regression**: A statistical method used to model the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
- **Polynomial Regression**: A form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable is modeled as an nth degree polynomial, allowing for a more flexible fit to the data.

## Dataset

The dataset, `economic_index.csv`, includes economic indicators such as interest rates and index prices. This data serves as a practical example to illustrate the regression techniques. The dataset consists of the following columns:
- `interest_rate`: Represents the interest rate over a given period.
- `index_price`: Represents the economic index price corresponding to the interest rate.

## Files Included

- **`multiple_linear_regression.py`**: This script shows how to implement Multiple Linear Regression, where you will learn how to:
  - Load and preprocess the dataset.
  - Split the data into training and testing sets.
  - Train a linear regression model.
  - Evaluate the model and visualize the results.
- **`polynomial_regression.py`**: This script demonstrates Polynomial Regression, providing insights into how to:
  - Extend the features to polynomial terms.
  - Fit a polynomial regression model.
  - Analyze and plot the results for a better fit compared to linear regression.
- **`economic_index.csv`**: The dataset used in the examples, which contains economic indicators to apply the regression techniques.

## Key Features

- **Educational Scripts**: Step-by-step scripts for learning and implementing Multiple and Polynomial Regression.
- **Practical Dataset**: A real-world economic dataset to practice and understand regression applications.
- **Visualizations**: Includes code for plotting and visualizing the regression results to enhance understanding.

## Who Is This For?

- **Students and Learners**: Ideal for those who are learning data science and want hands-on examples of regression techniques.
- **Data Enthusiasts**: Anyone interested in applying statistical methods to real-world data.
- **Educators**: Useful resource for teaching regression concepts with practical examples.
